This SQL script sets up a housing management system in a database named `hstl`. It creates tables for **Resident**, **Guardian**, **Rent**, **Room**, and **Work**,
each storing relevant details like personal information, rent payments, room assignments, and work affiliations.
The script inserts sample data into these tables and includes queries to retrieve, join, and aggregate data. Additionally,
several views are created to summarize resident-related information, including contact details,
rent summaries, and work details. This system helps in managing and querying housing and resident data efficiently.
